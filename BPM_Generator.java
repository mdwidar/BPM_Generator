/*
   The BPM_Generator is a metronome that derives tempo using a stop-watch function.  
   When the user clicks on it, this metronome starts timing.  When the user clicks again,
   it displays the time between the two clicks.  Clicking a third time
   starts the process over again. After the temporal distance between clicks 
   is measured, the program produces an output displaying the BPM of the clicked tempo.
   There are additional calculations added for variations on the generated BPM.
